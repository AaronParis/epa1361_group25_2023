## EPA1361 Model-based Decision-making 2023 - Group 25

Welcome to the epa1361 repository of group 25. This repository contains the files for our final assignment, including the dike model, 
the data and two jupyter notebooks created for the two parts of our analysis ("Open_Exploration" and "Multi-scenario_MORDM"). 
Both are designed so that they can be run fully without prior adjustments. However, as we have nto achieved convergence in 
the optimisation (due to limited computational power), we decided to include the savefiles from our analysis to make sure that 
the results can be replicated. This is done by saving results to different files than those that are loaded subsequently. The saved files 
can be found in the directory 'open_exploration' and 'Multi-scenario MORDM -> savefiles'. 
Apart from the notebooks for open exploration and multi-scenario MORDM no new dependencies exist in comparison to the original final assignment repository.
